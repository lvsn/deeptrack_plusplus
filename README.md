# DeepTrack++

Upgrades to the 6DoF object tracker presented in : "A Framework for Evaluating 6-DOF Object Trackers" [\[arxiv paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10075).

The original code release can be found at this [website](https://github.com/lvsn/6DOF_tracking_evaluation).

The dataset can be downloaded at this [website](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/publications/projects/6dofObjectTracking/index.html).

## Changes to DeepTrack

The ``bb3d`` parameter is used for depth values clipping, detailed in Charles Renaud's thesis (under review).

The ``newbg3`` parameter is used for the background values augmentation scheme, detailed in Charles Renaud's thesis (under review).

Includes the `fpnet` architecture from [FoundationPose](https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationPose).

## Dependencies
To train the network, version 0.1 of [pytorch_toolbox](https://github.com/MathGaron/pytorch_toolbox/tree/v0.1) is required.

Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
